Iris Dataset Classification Project
Overview
This project involves classifying Iris flowers using a machine learning model.
This dataset provides measurements of various Iris flowers and their species.
This covers data processing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using django to create a web application where users can input Iris flower measurements and receive species predictions.

Troubleshooting
 Dependencies Issues: Ensure all packages in requirements.txt are installed. Use pip install -r requirements.txt.
 Model Not Loading: Verify that iris_model.joblib exists in the src/ directory and is correctly referenced in app.py.
